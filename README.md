#Josef Zoucha CS-305
For this project, I worked with Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops personalized financial plans and wanted to modernize its systems while ensuring its RESTful API was secure. My task was to conduct a vulnerability assessment, identify risks, and recommend solutions. I did well in documenting vulnerabilities through both manual review and static testing, which highlighted the importance of coding securely to protect client data and maintain customer trust. The most challenging part was interpreting dependency-check results, but this also helped me learn how to verify findings. To increase layers of security, I recommended implementing encryption, adhering to secure coding practices, and managing dependencies. I would also continue using tools like Maven and following OWASP standards in the future. After refactoring, I tested functionality and rechecked vulnerabilities to confirm that no new issues were introduced. The tools, coding practices, and documentation process I used will be valuable in future work, and this project serves as a strong portfolio piece to demonstrate my ability to assess, secure, and communicate about software vulnerabilities.
